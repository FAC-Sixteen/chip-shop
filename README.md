## Project Setup

To run locally, clone this repo and run `npm i` to install packages.
* `npm start` to run locally

## Goals

Use React to build an interactive game that uses data from an API.


### Core Project Goals:
- [x] Query a movie API for movie names
- [x] Populate the UI with API data
- [x] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity

### Our Goals:
- [x] Hangman game!
- [x] Render a hangman word with underscores
- [x] Guess a letter and if right amend word
- [x] Create counter to track guesses
- [x] Create counter to track guesses
- [ ] Connect counter to incorrect guesses
- [x] CSS
- [x] Responsive
- [x] Use create-react-app

## Problems

* Connecting counter to only trigger on incorrect guesses
* Uplifting react state
* Showing correctly guessed letters (thanks to Sophia)
* CSS wizardry

## Cool stuff we learned

* React and react state
* Using repl-it for difficult algorithms to more easily write and run individual functions.
